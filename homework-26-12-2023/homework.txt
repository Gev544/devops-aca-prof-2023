write a bash script

1. script should be used as a error handling tool with functions in it to be sourced from other scripts
2. script should contain error handling functions for aws-cli commands
3. script should get aws command as an argument

f.e. source aws_tools.sh
     aws_command="aws ec2 create instance"
     instance_id=$(aws_tools_run aws_command)

hint: use "eval" command
